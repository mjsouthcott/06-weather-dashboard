# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application displays the current weather and five-day forecast for a city specified by the user. It runs in the browser, and features dynamically updating HTML and CSS, powered by jQuery and the OpenWeather API.

This application meets all of the acceptance criteria specified by the customer:
- The user can search for new cities using form inputs.
- The dashboard displays current and future conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index.
- The colour of the UV index badge changes to reflect its severity.
- The user can display conditions for previously searched cities by clicking on the city in the search history.
- When the dashboard is launched, it displays the forecast for the last searched city.
